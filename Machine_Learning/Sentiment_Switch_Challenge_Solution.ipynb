    "\n",
    "**Scenario:**  \n",
    "You‚Äôve inherited a sentiment classifier trained on movie reviews, but your team needs it to analyze product reviews. Your job is to curate a small training set and evaluate performance before and after adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook Steps:**  \n",
    "1. Load product review data and inspect samples.  \n",
    "2. Run several reviews through the existing model to evaluate fit.  \n",
    "3. Select 5‚Äì10 balanced examples for fine-tuning.  \n",
    "4. (Optional) Apply model adaptation using the sample function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**  \n",
    "- Labeled product review samples  \n",
    "- Comparison of model predictions before/after adaptation  \n",
    "- Explanation of adaptation decisions and impact on task relevance\n"
