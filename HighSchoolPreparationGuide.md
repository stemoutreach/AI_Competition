# High School Preparation Guide

## Must-Have Courses
- **Algebra I/II** – variables, functions, logic  
- **Geometry** – spatial reasoning, stepwise problem-solving  
- **Intro to Computer Science / AP CS Principles** – computational thinking, basic Python, algorithms  
- **English / Technical Writing** – clear documentation & communication  
- **Civics / Ethics** – privacy, bias, fairness, accountability (DoD AI Ethics alignment)  

## Strongly Recommended
- **Statistics (AP or regular)** – data summaries, distributions, evaluation  
- **Python Programming** – loops, lists/dicts, CSVs, plotting  
- **Data Science / Data Literacy** – cleaning, visualizing, decision-making  
- **Physics** – experimental design, analyzing noisy data  
- **Speech / Debate** – presenting evidence, quick communication  

## Nice-to-Have
- **AP CS A (Java)** – deeper algorithms/structures  
- **Discrete Math** – sets, graphs, combinatorics  
- **Linear Algebra** (honors/dual credit) – vectors/matrices; ML intuition  
- **Graphic Design / Media** – visuals for reports, dashboards, slides  
- **Business / Entrepreneurship** – framing problems, stakeholder thinking  

## Stretch / Specialty
- **Robotics / Engineering (FIRST, VEX, maker courses)** – teamwork, iterative testing  
- **Cybersecurity** – secure handling of data, model/agent safety mindset  
- **Cloud Fundamentals / IT Essentials** – files, version control, CLI  
- **Philosophy / Social Studies electives** – bias, governance, policy

## Skills Checklist
- [ ] Completed **Algebra II** (or currently enrolled)  
- [ ] Took **Intro CS/AP CSP** or have **Python + Jupyter** experience  
- [ ] Completed (or currently in) **Statistics**  
- [ ] Can **load a CSV**, make a **basic plot**, and **explain a result**  
- [ ] Practiced a **5-minute team presentation** (problem → method → result → limits → ethics)  
- [ ] Had at least **one ethics discussion** on bias/fairness/privacy  

---

## Quick Pre-Quest Mini-Labs
1. **Python + Jupyter Warm-Up** – read CSV, run `.describe()`, create two plots  
2. **Clean & Compare** – handle missing values, compare features  
3. **Ethics Snapshot** – identify potential bias & propose mitigation  

---

### Goal
Students should arrive **AI Quest-ready**: confident in Python basics, data handling, ethics, and teamwork under time constraints.
