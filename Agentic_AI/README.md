# Agentic AI Mini‑Challenge Starters

This bundle contains **starter kits** for three high‑school‑level Agentic AI challenges (1–3 hours each). Each folder includes minimal scaffolding, datasets, and TODOs.

- `Challenge1_City_Park_Advisory/` — Plan‑Act‑Observe‑Revise loop over a small Info Pack to produce a cited recommendation.
- `Challenge2_TDD_Scheduler/` — Test‑Driven Development to build a useful day scheduler from `tasks.csv`.
- `Challenge3_Civic_FAQ_Agent/` — Retrieval Q&A agent with citations and refusal/redirect policy.

See each folder’s `README.md` for quickstart.
